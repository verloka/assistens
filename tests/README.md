# Build and test

Requires Windows and the .NET SDK selected by `global.json` (currently 10.0.401).
No commercial API key, tenant credentials or bot token is needed for the current tests.

From the repository root, run the full verification with one command:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

The script restores in locked mode, builds, and runs all test projects. A failing
command stops the script with an error. Use `-Configuration Release` for Release.

Equivalent individual commands:

```powershell
dotnet restore --locked-mode
dotnet build --no-restore
dotnet test --no-build
```

Run a focused group with `dotnet test --filter DesktopHostTests` or
`dotnet test --filter HealthScreenTests`.

- `PersonalAgent.UnitTests`: module boundary and reference cycle checks.
- `PersonalAgent.IntegrationTests`: actual Generic Host and SDK loading; host
  probes/fakes (`ProbeService`, `CancellableWorker`, recording logger) cover
  cancellation and failure cleanup. WPF tests load the real XAML on STA threads
  and pump the dispatcher without displaying windows or generating input.
- `PersonalAgent.E2ETests`: reserved scaffold; no tests yet. A successful command
  or a "no tests available" message is not business E2E acceptance.

Add scenario links to existing FDD Drafts only when corresponding tests exist;
never promote them to Active without explicit approval. Keep live/manual provider,
device and corporate checks separate from fake/local evidence. The ten E2E cases
and MVP release gate remain unverified until their own backlog tasks are completed.

## MAF tool and approval diagnostic (PA-006)

```powershell
dotnet test --filter MafToolApprovalSpikeTests
```

The real MAF 1.25.0 pipeline uses `ScriptedChatClient` as its `IChatClient`.
The deterministic fake returns function-call content and a final response; the
SDK performs the actual tool dispatch and approval handshake. No network or key
is used, and the only tool echoes data in memory.

Observed API sequence:

1. Create `ChatClientAgent` with a local `AIFunctionFactory.Create` tool.
2. Wrap protected tools in `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`.
3. Create an `AgentSession` with `CreateSessionAsync` and call `RunAsync`.
4. Read `ToolApprovalRequestContent` from the response messages; the protected
   function has not run yet.
5. Pass `request.CreateResponse(true/false)` in a user `ChatMessage` to `RunAsync`
   with the same session. Approval invokes the original function once; denial
   continues the conversation without invoking it.

Tests also verify that the default MAF approval-response binding cannot substitute
the original arguments, and that an already-cancelled run invokes neither model
nor tool. Do not disable that binding or use the wrapper alone as a security policy:
`ApprovalRequiredAIFunction` is a marker, and its invoker must enforce approval.

Limits: this fake is non-streaming. Live OpenAI/Anthropic, vision, durable approvals,
identity/expiry checks, restart/session persistence, replay protection and unknown
external outcomes are not covered. The SDK diagnostic is not the application's
complete approval or task flow; those FDD scenarios remain untested.
